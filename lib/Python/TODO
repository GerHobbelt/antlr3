- setup.py
- implement more examples
- antlr features
  - backtracking
  - memoize
  - ASTs
  - error handling & recovery
  - scopes
- turn some methods into attributes
  - (String|CommonToken)Stream.index()
  - (String|CommonToken)Stream.size() --> __len__
- proper indention of actions
- documentation in docstrings
- document differences to java API
- add methods to emulate java API, but mark 'em as deprecated
- optimizations which should be explored:
  - DFA: perhaps zip() the lists into a tuple 
    (eot, eof, min, max, accept, special, transition)
    for each state. checkout potential performance gain.
  - StringStream: look into optimizing LA(). Perhaps use LAk instead of LA(k)
    and create the attributes when needed.
  - Perform some magic to improve dfaStateSwitch.
