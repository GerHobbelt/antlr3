    STATIC LIBRARY : C Project Overview

Blah blah T bags.

Currently this is just a place holder. 

So far I have made some guesses at waht to genrate for the main lexer bits. Just a few
hours work really. I will try generating some code shortly and see what comes out. Though
I am going to generate doxygen commented code, I am going to concentrate on minimising
memory allocations and speed, which might require goto, thguh I always swore that I woudl never
use goto in C except under teh most drastic circumstances. Hower here, ther user is not
supposed ot maintain the C code, and every C generator I ahve written used gotot ;-).

more balh blah
