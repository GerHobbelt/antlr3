1) ABOUT
========

This is the ActionScript package 'antlr3', which is required to use parsers created
by the ANTLR3 tool. See <http://www.antlr.org/> for more information about
ANTLR3.


2) STATUS
=========

The ActionScript target for ANTLR3 is still in beta. Documentation is lacking, some
bits of the code is not yet done, some functionality has not been tested yet.
Also the API might change a bit - it currently mimics the Java implementation,
but takes advantage of ActionScript constrcuts where possible.


3) DOWNLOAD
===========

This runtime is part of the ANTLR distribution. The latest version can be found
at <http://www.antlr.org/download.html>.

If you are interested in the latest, most bleeding edge version, have a look at
the perforce depot at <http://fisheye2.cenqua.com/browse/antlr>. There are
tarballs ready to download, so you don't have to install the perforce client.


4) USAGE
===============

Include the antlr3.swc from the lib directory into your flex project.

5) DOCUMENTATION
================

API Documentation is available in the "doc" directory.  User documentation
(as far as it exists) can be found in the wiki
<http://www.antlr.org/wiki/display/ANTLR3/Antlr3ActionScriptTarget>


6) REPORTING BUGS
=================

Please send bug reports to the ANTLR mailing list 
<http://www.antlr.org:8080/mailman/listinfo/antlr-interest> or
<george.scott-antrl@gmail.com>

Existing bugs may appear someday in the bugtracker:
<http://www.antlr.org:8888/browse/ANTLR>


7) HACKING
==========

Only the runtime package can be found here. There are also some StringTemplate
files in 'src/org/antlr/codegen/templates/ActionScript/' and some Java code in
'src/org/antlr/codegen/ActionScriptTarget.java' (of the main ANTLR3 source
distribution).

The 'project' directory contains everything you need to rebuild the library from source.
It also includes all unit tests.

Please send patches to <george.scott-antlr@gmail.com>. For larger code contributions you'll
have to sign the "Developer's Certificate of Origin", which can be found on
<http://www.antlr.org/license.html> or use the feedback form at
<http://www.antlr.org/misc/feedback>.
